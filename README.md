# ST-GP4AO - Spatiotemporal GP implementation for Adaptive Optics

This repository contains the codes for the paper "The power of prediction: spatiotemporal Gaussian process modeling for predictive control in slope-based wavefront sensing," currently under review.

We have prepared Jupyter-notebooks files that generate the results from different sections. 

Files "prediction_8x8" and "prediction_40x40" provide code for the results in the subsection "Wavefront prediction and noise reduction." The paper results are done with a 40x40 system, while we added the 8x8 for convenience since computing the 40x40 system takes 32GB of RAM.

File "Anti-aliasing" includes codes for the "Anti-aliasing"-subsection.
