# ST-GP4AO - Spatiotemporal GP implementation for Adaptive Optics

This repository contains the codes for the paper "The power of prediction: spatiotemporal Gaussian process modeling for predictive control in slope-based wavefront sensing," currently under review.

We have prepared Jupyter-notebooks files that generate the results of different sections. 

The basic usages of the codes can be studied with the files "prediction_8x8" and "prediction_40x40", as well as, file "Anti-aliasing" includes codes for the "Anti-aliasing"-subsection.
The more memory demanding and complicated reslts of the paper are in the folder article files.

The repository is under development, and updates (such as creating the system matrices) are expected.
